# SwaglabsDemo End-to-End Test Suite

This repository contains an end-to-end test suite for SwaglabsDemo using Playwright, implemented with the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern. The tests automate the login, shopping cart interactions, and checkout processes for a standard user on the SwaglabsDemo website.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Before running the tests, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 12 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git
   cd repository-name
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

---

## Running Tests

To run the test suite using Playwright, use the following command:

```bash
npx playwright test
```

This command will execute all test files located in the `tests` directory, using the Playwright test runner. Ensure that your Playwright configurations (like browsers to use) are set up correctly in the `playwright.config.js` file.

---

## Folder Structure

The project structure is organized to follow the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern for maintainability and readability:

```
├── pages/                 # Page Object Model (POM) classes
│   ├── pageobject.js       # Page object for all model

│   └── ...                # Additional page objects as needed
├── tests/                 # Test files
│   └── Home_test.spec.js   # Example end-to-end test using Playwright
├── playwright.config.js   # Playwright configuration file
└── package.json           # Node.js package descriptor
```

### Explanation:

- **`pages/`**: Contains Page Object Model (POM) classes, each representing a specific page on the SauceDemo website.
- **`tests/`**: Contains test files that utilize the Page Objects to perform end-to-end tests.
- **`playwright.config.js`**: Configuration file for Playwright, where you define browsers, test settings, etc.
- **`package.json`**: Node.js package descriptor file with dependencies and scripts.

## Writing Tests

### Page Object Model (POM)

Each page of the Swaglabs website (e.g., login, inventory, cart, checkout) has its own Page Object model class located in the `pages/` directory. These classes encapsulate page-specific functionality and selectors.

### Example Test

Here’s an example of an end-to-end test (`Home_test.spec.js`) using Playwright and the Page Object Model:

```javascript
const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');
const LoginPage = require('../pages/loginPage');
const InventoryPage = require('../pages/inventoryPage');
const CartPage = require('../pages/cartPage');
const CheckoutPage = require('../pages/checkoutPage');

test('Swaglab end-to-end test', async ({ page }) => {
  const loginPage = new LoginPage(page);
  const inventoryPage = new InventoryPage(page);
  const cartPage = new CartPage(page);
  const checkoutPage = new CheckoutPage(page);

  // Step 1: Navigate to the website
  await loginPage.navigate();

  // Step 2: Login as standard_user
  await loginPage.login('standard_user', 'secret_sauce');

  // Step 3: Add items to cart
  await inventoryPage.addItemsToCart(2); // Add 2 items

  // Step 4: Verify the correct items were added to the cart
  await inventoryPage.goToCart();
  await cartPage.verifyItemsInCart(2);

  // Step 5: Complete checkout process
  await cartPage.clickCheckout();
  await checkoutPage.fillCheckoutInformation('John', 'Doe', '12345');
  await checkoutPage.completeCheckout();

  // Verification
  const thankYouHeader = await page.locator('.complete-header').innerText();
  expect(thankYouHeader).toBe('THANK YOU FOR YOUR ORDER');
});
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while running the tests, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

- **Check Dependencies**: Ensure all required dependencies are installed (`npm install` or `yarn install`).
- **Playwright Configuration**: Verify Playwright configurations in `playwright.config.js`.
- **Browser Permissions**: Ensure browsers have necessary permissions and are updated.
- **Debugging**: Add debugging logs to your Page Object classes or test files to trace execution flow.
